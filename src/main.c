Tips:
	- ICMP packets are raw packets, so you'll need root permissions to send them.
		if (getuid() != 0) {
			fprintf(stderr,"Root privileges are required to run ft_ping.\n");

	- The checksum is critical for ensuring data integrity.
	- The structure includes support for various ICMP message types, such as Echo, Destination Unreachable, and Time Exceeded.

/*
ICMP structure from <netinet/ip_icmp.h>

A union in C is a special construct that allows multiple variables of different types to share the same memory location.
	- All fields inside a union share the same memory.
	- The size of a union is determined by its largest member
	- It is used to save memory when only one of the fields will be used at a time.

structure:
	- type: Specifies the type of ICMP message:
		0 Echo Reply
		3 Destination Unreachable
		8 Echo Request (using in ping)
		5 Redirection

	- code: Provides additional context for the type:
		for type = 3
			0: Network Unreachable
			1: Host Unreachable
			2: Protocol Unreachable
			4: Fragmentation Needed
		for type = 5
			0: Redirect for a specific network
			1: Redirect for a specific host
			2: Redirect for a specific type of service and network
			3: Redirect for a specific type of service and host

	- checksum: Ensures data integrity for the ICMP packet.
		Calculated over the entire ICMP packet, including the header and data.

	- union un: is used to hold different types of data depending on the ICMP message type (type).
		Each ICMP message type defines which specific field in the union is used.
		Here is some cases:
			- type = 8 (Echo request) or type = 0 (Echo reply) the echo field is used:
				- id:
					Uniquely identifies the process or device sending the ICMP packet.
					(usually derived from the process ID of the application initiating the request).

					Ensures that replies are correctly matched with requests.
				- sequence:
					Tracks the order of ICMP packets.
					Helps detect packet loss and calculate round-trip time RTT.

				ex:
					Request: id = 100, sequence = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
					Reply:   id = 100, sequence = 1, 2, 4, 5 (sequence 3 is missing)
			- type = 5 (Redirect) The gateway field is used.
				- gateway: The gateway field stores the IP address of a new gateway (router) that the sender of the ICMP Redirect message suggests the target should use.
					To inform a host about a more efficient route to a destination. This is part of the network optimization process to reduce latency and avoid inefficient routing paths.
					Example Scenario:
						1. Host A sends the packet to Router 1.
						2. Router 1 forwards the packet to Router 2 but also sends an ICMP Redirect message to Host A.
						3. Host A updates its routing table to use Router 2 for packets destined for Host B.
			- type = 3 and code = 4 (Fragmentation Needed) The frag field is used. It contains the MTU value for the next hop.

Implement SHA-256 for data integrity ???:
	- Use a cryptographic hash function to create a hash of the ICMP packet.
	- Include the hash in a custom field of the ICMP payload.
	- At the receiver end, recalculate the hash and compare it to the received hash.

doubts:

	- You are authorised to use the libc functions to complete this project.
	- You have to manage the -v -? options
	- The -v option here will also allow us to see the results in case of a

	force the program to stop (the modification of the TTL value can help
	to force an error).
